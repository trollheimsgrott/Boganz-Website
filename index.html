            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>At BoganZ we aim to capture some of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R vibes from the respective game series right into Sumrak's harsh Namalsk DayZ continent.</p>
          

            <h2>OUR HISTORY...THE BEGINNINGS...</h2>
            <p>Back in late 2020, <i class="fester">Uncle Fester</i> heard the old ARMA 2 map Namalsk was being ported to DayZ. Given his fondness for this terrain, he began developing backend scripts so he could launch a modded server on day 1 of the Namalsk terrain release. 

              On December 4 2020, the legendary Aleutian archipelago terrain that is Namalsk was released, and that same day BoganZ (DayZ server) was officially launched accompanied by a discord server. </p>
              
              <p>The server launched with minimal mods, which included Trader and Expansion. He felt expansion gave survivors access (at the time) to many innovative features such as helicopters and amphibious cars.</p><p>Within the Namalsk lore, there are many references to the legendary game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Moreover, <i class="fester">Fester</i> was impressed by one interesting DayZ project coming out of Russia - a group of devs bringing S.T.A.L.K.E.R content to the DayZ workshop. Once this was publicly released, and translation mods available, these mods were implemented into BoganZ.</p> 
              
              <p>After playing on the server for some months, <i class="troll">Trollheimsgrott</i> began collaborating in mid to late 2021, and work began building server content which would create an immense sense of dread using diverse S.T.A.L.K.E.R content and scripts. <i class="fester">Uncle Fester</i> and <i class="troll">Trollheimsgrott</i> then began on their journey to make life on the archipelago that much harder.. a direct reference to the harsh gameplay in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</p>

              <p>This gives players oftentimes a need to band together and help eachother out, which promoted a friendly server, but hostily is aplenty as well!</p>

        <div class ="timesdate"><h2>Thursday, 15 September 2022</h2></div>
        <p>STALKERS: We are overdue for a change up, while work is underway to create (what is almost certainly) the most diverse, realistic and the most accurately balanced difficulty system across all zombies, on any server, we have geared up to switch up our main weapons pack. (It is time for a fresh change, and we believe for the better.) Having taken on board a suggestion from our buddy  <i class="spotlight">Jibblets</i>,  we will be putting to rest Teddy's Weapons Pack, and Advanced Weapon Scopes mods. We will be replacing them with Dead Air Weapons Pack which is actually created with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. enterprise in mind. The pack brings in a minimal approach when it comes to skins, Wooden and rustic, and has one of the most well balanced damage effects I have seen on a weapon pack. The difference between weapon types and callibres is uncanny. It is for this mod pack that we will need to perform a wipe to prevent item loss issues. I will be going out of town in the next day or so, and plan to switch over when im back in town. I fly back the 25th of September. This places a wipe likely sometime between 26th and 28th of September. Work will continue on the Zombie difficulty at this time also.</p>

          STALKERS: Earlier this morning at approximately 0730 an explosion was heard to the east of Refugee Camp RF1. STALKERS carrying out a routine clear of the place reported a minor tremble at the same time as the explosion. Aleksandr went to the east to investigate, and returned gravely ill, complaining of the taste of metal in his mouth and burning skin. During a formal debrief Aleksandr sadly passed.

                            ATTENTION   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S :  Firstly I want to apologise for being several days behind the ball on this announcement, as I have been and still am contending with assignments. I would like to thank each and every one of you, for your continued support. Most especially our Patreon, Paypal, and Bank transfer donators. Due to a final colossal effort we have reached our goal, and purchased gear for a server. The server is already up and running and in play - as of Wednesday 10th August '22. Only due to assignments is the announcement late.  Check it out here: <a onclick="showPage('gallery-server-images')">Server Images</a>

        <p>
                            ATTENTION   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S :  We performed an economy overhaul today, fixing a lot of errors in the loot spawn table. there are still minor things we are looking to iron out, but the loot table should be a lot more balanced now, as a sidenote, unfortunately this resulted in a player base wipe- no way to distinguish between the two . Feel free to open a ticket in Discord #help and let us know the major items you lost, we can verify these from the trader logs. Apologies for the inconvenience, but we hope you enjoy the new loot table better!
